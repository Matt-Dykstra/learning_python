# Python Object Oriented Programming Examples

### Example 1:

```python
class Person:
    pass  # An empty block

p = Person()
print(p)
```

###### Output:

```
$ python oop_simplestclass.py
<__main__.Person instance at 0x10171f518>
```

### Example 2:
 
```python
class Person:
    def say_hi(self):
        print('Hello, how are you?')

p = Person()
p.say_hi()
# The previous 2 lines can also be written as
# Person().say_hi()
```

###### Output:

```
$ python oop_method.py
Hello, how are you?
```

### Example 3:

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def say_hi(self):
        print('Hello, my name is', self.name)

p = Person('Swaroop')
p.say_hi()
# The previous 2 lines can also be written as
# Person('Swaroop').say_hi()
```

###### Output:

```
$ python oop_init.py
Hello, my name is Swaroop
```

### Example 4:

```python
class Robot:
    """Represents a robot, with a name."""

    # A class variable, counting the number of robots
    population = 0

    def __init__(self, name):
        """Initializes the data."""
        self.name = name
        print("(Initializing {})".format(self.name))

        # When this person is created, the robot
        # adds to the population
        Robot.population += 1

    def die(self):
        """I am dying."""
        print("{} is being destroyed!".format(self.name))

        Robot.population -= 1

        if Robot.population == 0:
            print("{} was the last one.".format(self.name))
        else:
            print("There are still {:d} robots working.".format(
                Robot.population))

    def say_hi(self):
        """Greeting by the robot.

        Yeah, they can do that."""
        print("Greetings, my masters call me {}.".format(self.name))

    @classmethod
    def how_many(cls):
        """Prints the current population."""
        print("We have {:d} robots.".format(cls.population))


droid1 = Robot("R2-D2")
droid1.say_hi()
Robot.how_many()

droid2 = Robot("C-3PO")
droid2.say_hi()
Robot.how_many()

print("\nRobots can do some work here.\n")

print("Robots have finished their work. So let's destroy them.")
droid1.die()
droid2.die()

Robot.how_many()
```

###### Output:

```
$ python oop_objvar.py
(Initializing R2-D2)
Greetings, my masters call me R2-D2.
We have 1 robots.
(Initializing C-3PO)
Greetings, my masters call me C-3PO.
We have 2 robots.

Robots can do some work here.

Robots have finished their work. So let's destroy them.
R2-D2 is being destroyed!
There are still 1 robots working.
C-3PO is being destroyed!
C-3PO was the last one.
We have 0 robots.
```

```python
class SchoolMember:
    '''Represents any school member.'''
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        print('(Initialized SchoolMember: {})'.format(self.name))

    def tell(self):
        '''Tell my details.'''
        print('Name:"{}" Age:"{}"'.format(self.name, self.age), end=" ")


class Teacher(SchoolMember):
    '''Represents a teacher.'''
    def __init__(self, name, age, salary):
        SchoolMember.__init__(self, name, age)
        self.salary = salary
        print('(Initialized Teacher: {})'.format(self.name))

    def tell(self):
        SchoolMember.tell(self)
        print('Salary: "{:d}"'.format(self.salary))


class Student(SchoolMember):
    '''Represents a student.'''
    def __init__(self, name, age, marks):
        SchoolMember.__init__(self, name, age)
        self.marks = marks
        print('(Initialized Student: {})'.format(self.name))

    def tell(self):
        SchoolMember.tell(self)
        print('Marks: "{:d}"'.format(self.marks))

t = Teacher('Mrs. Shrividya', 40, 30000)
s = Student('Swaroop', 25, 75)

# prints a blank line
print()

members = [t, s]
for member in members:
    # Works for both Teachers and Students
    member.tell()
```

###### Output:

```
$ python oop_subclass.py
(Initialized SchoolMember: Mrs. Shrividya)
(Initialized Teacher: Mrs. Shrividya)
(Initialized SchoolMember: Swaroop)
(Initialized Student: Swaroop)

Name:"Mrs. Shrividya" Age:"40" Salary: "30000"
Name:"Swaroop" Age:"25" Marks: "75"
```
